    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the technique of using multiple processes to achieve parallel execution of tasks. Unlike multithreading, \n",
    "where threads share the same memory space, multiprocessing involves separate memory spaces for each process. This allows processes to\n",
    "run independently, making use of multiple processor cores for true parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Parallelism: Unlike multithreading, where Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the concurrency of threads, multiprocessing \n",
    "allows you to achieve true parallelism. Each process runs in its own interpreter and can fully utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Improvement: Multiprocessing is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks, where the program spends a significant amount of time\n",
    "\n",
    "performing computations. By distributing the workload across multiple processes, you can potentially achieve faster execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation: Since each process has its own memory space, there's less risk of data corruption due to shared memory access. This can simplify\n",
    "programming by reducing the chances of race conditions and other concurrency-related bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Multiprocessing allows you to share data between processes using IPC mechanisms. This can be helpful for communication\n",
    "and coordination between different parts of an application."

   "source": [
    "1. Isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space, allowing for better isolation between processes. This reduces the risk of data\n",
    "corruption due to shared memory access and simplifies programming in terms of avoiding race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads within the same process share memory space, which can lead to potential data corruption or race conditions if\n",
    "proper synchronization mechanisms are not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Achieves true parallelism, as each process runs in its own interpreter and can fully utilize multiple CPU cores. This\n",
    "makes multiprocessing suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism, allowing only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "This makes multithreading more suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Generally provides better performance for CPU-bound tasks due to the ability to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Might not provide significant performance improvements for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL limitation. However, it can be\n",
    "useful for I/O-bound tasks, where the bottleneck is waiting for external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resource Sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Uses inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, and shared memory for communication and data sharing\n",
    "between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Shares memory space, making data sharing between threads more efficient, but it requires careful synchronization mechanisms\n",
    "to avoid race conditions."
